# Version 3.0.0

  Core logic re-write along with settings moved to maps so they can be multithreaded and setup responsive scales better.

  * Settings moved into a map.
  * Multiple settings threads so you can use different scales in tandem.
  * Removed the list funciton that outputs a list of values.
  * Removed multiple ratio support because it was confusing and you should use multiple threads anyway. This dramatically reduced the core logic and bugs.
  * Fluid is the only responsive setting.
  * Responsive mixin automatically pulls breakpoints from map threads.
  * find ratios based on target sizes at points on the scale.

  * lists() is the list functions
  * No more mixins at all, only functions.
  * Increased compatibility with Sass 3.1 and up
  * Compatibility with LibSass
  * Compass no longer required (non-integer values require Compass)
